# Belarus Car Price Prediction
This project aims to predict the price of cars in Belarus by analyzing various car features such as brand, year, engine, fuel type, transmission, mileage, drive unit, color, and segment. The objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of a car based on its characteristics.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle. It consists of 56,244 rows and 12 columns. Each row represents a car listing, and the columns contain information about the car's attributes and the corresponding price. The dataset provides a comprehensive set of variables that can be used to analyze and predict car prices in Belarus.

Project Structure
The project repository is organized as follows:
- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset file(s) used for analysis and model training.
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the project structure.

Results and Analysis
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates car prices in Belarus. The trained models can be evaluated using various performance metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score. The models can also be used to make predictions on new, unseen car data.
Additionally, feature importance analysis can be conducted to determine the variables that have the most significant impact on car prices. This analysis can provide insights into the factors that drive car prices and help understand the market dynamics in Belarus.
